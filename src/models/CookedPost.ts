/**
 * A user's proof-of-cook post for a recipe: a photo of what they actually made,
 * an optional caption, and the recipe's cuisine tags captured at post-time.
 *
 * Cuisine tags are snapshotted here (rather than resolved through Recipe at
 * read time) so the passport stamp map remains stable even if the recipe is
 * later edited or deleted. Tags align with Taste-the-World markers by cuisine
 * adjective (e.g. "Lebanese", "Italian").
 *
 * Soft-delete fields (`removedAt`, `removedBy`, `removalReason`) capture
 * recipe-owner moderation actions. A removed post stays in Mongo so admins can
 * audit it, but every read path filters it out and passport stamps earned via
 * a removed post collapse back.
